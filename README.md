## ‚ú® Features

### üîπ Algorithm Implementation
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Non-Preemptive Priority
- Accurately simulates process execution order and scheduling decisions.

### üîπ Performance Analysis
- Calculates **Waiting Time**, **Turnaround Time**, and **Average Times** for all processes.
- Allows comparison between algorithms to highlight trade-offs in **efficiency**, and **throughput**.

### üîπ Flexible Input Handling
- Accepts process data directly from file input.
- File input allows automated testing with larger datasets.
- Easily replicate scenarios and validate scheduling outcomes.

### üîπ Interactive Simulation
- Console interface for entering or loading process details:
  - Arrival time
  - Burst time
  - Priority
- Displays results in a clean **tabular format**.
